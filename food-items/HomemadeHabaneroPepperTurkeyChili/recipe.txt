2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 medium red bell pepper, medium dice
1 medium yellow onion, medium dice
3 Habanero Peppers
2 medium garlic cloves, coarsely chopped
1 pound ground turkey
3 tablespoons chili powder
2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth or stock
2 (14-ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1 bay leaf


1 - Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add the bell pepper, onion, and garlic, season with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have softened, about 5 to 8 minutes.

2 - Increase the heat to medium high, add the turkey, and cook, breaking it up into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon, until itâ€™s no longer pink and is just cooked through, about 4 to 6 minutes.

3 - Add the chili powder, measured salt, oregano, cumin, cayenne, and cinnamon, stir to coat the turkey and vegetables, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

4 - Add the tomatoes and their juices as well as the broth or stock, stir to combine, and bring to a simmer. Add the beans and return to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium low, add the bay leaf, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the flavors meld, about 30 minutes.

5 - Remove the bay leaf. Taste and season with additional salt as needed. Serve with the cheese, sour cream, and chips, for topping.
